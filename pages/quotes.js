        人要培養六樣東西： 揚在臉上的自信、 長在心底的善良、  融進血裡的骨氣、
        兩側外洩的霸氣、  隨時學習的智慧、 刻入命裡的堅強！
      </p>
      <p>How people treat you is their karmas, how you react is yours.</p>
      <p>
        Watch your thoughts; for they become words.  Watch your words; for they
        become actions.  Watch your actions; for they become habits.  Watch your
        habits; for they become character.  Watch your character for it will
        become your destiny.
